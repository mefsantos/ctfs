rabbit-hole is a tip for nested hidden (compressed) files
use binwalk -e to extract hidden content
now start the recursive decompression:
decompress file
if we get a data not containing the flag its probably an hexadump of another compressed file so we use:
xxd -r in out
check the actual filetype, move to the corresponding type and keep decompressing

flag{c0mpr3ss10n_1s_fun}
