first mount the filesystem :
mkdir mountpoint
sudo mount -t ntfs family.ntfs mountpoint
check the file mountpoint/USersFamily/Documents/credentials.txt
-> it says we need to seek extended atributes
i used this command to dump the extended attributes:
$sudo find ~/ -type f  -iname "*" -exec getfattr -d {} + | grep  -v '\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-' > reportdump.txt

(use slethKit - containts fls and icat)

list all the files (-Fr for recursion)
$fls -Fr family.ntfs | grep "credentials.txt"

get the id(inode number) of the file with extended attributes
"r/r 13288-128-4:	Users/Family/Documents/credentials.txt:FILE0"

icat = "image cat" to get information of the data contained in the extended attributes
$icat family.ntfs 13288-128-4 > inode_dump

use 'file' to check info

$file inode_dump
inode_dump: PNG image data, 1234 x 339, 8-bit/color RGB, non-interlaced

its a png so we can move icat to a img.png file and try to open

use tesseract (OCR) to extract the flag
$tesseract creds.png creds
$cat creds.txt | grep "CTF" > flag.txt
